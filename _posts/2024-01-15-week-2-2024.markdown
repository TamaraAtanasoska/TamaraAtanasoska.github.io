This week I used up all my time outside work to brainstorm the details of my thesis topic, and work on my Pyladies Berlin talk called "Writing a custom scikit-learn estimator". The event was yesterday evening and it was such a great night! Before me, my colleague Stefanie Senger gave a talk about the metadata routing API in scikit-learn, which is an great feature and worth your time to check it out.

[On this link you can find the video from the night's stream, my talk starts the exactly 1:00h mark :).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bclnqfyKG4)
