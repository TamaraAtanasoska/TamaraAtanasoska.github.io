This week, I used all my time outside work to brainstorm the details of my thesis topic and work on my Pyladies Berlin talk called “Writing a custom scikit-learn estimator”. The event was yesterday evening, and it was such a great night! Before me, my colleague Stefanie Senger talked about the metadata routing API in scikit-learn, which is a great feature and worth checking out.

[On this link you can find the video from the night's stream, my talk starts the exactly 1:00h mark :).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bclnqfyKG4)
The slides from my presentation you can find [here](https://pitch.com/v/writing-a-custom-scikit-learn-estimator-7te8fd).

Links and resources from the presentation:

* [What we do as OSS team at :probabl.](https://papers.probabl.ai/open-source-priorities-chapter-2)
* [Documentation about developing a custom estimator](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html)
* Link to the [validation module documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/api/sklearn.utils.html#module-sklearn.utils.validation), and the [source code](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/utils/validation.py) of the module.
* [A video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp_L6Vsnhpc) covering check_array() and check_X_y() from the validation module.
* [Source code of the estimator_checks](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py).
* [Documentation and a list](https://scikit-learn.org/1.6/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.Tags.html) of available estimator tags, and [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/1.6/developers/develop.html#estimator-tags) how to use them.
* [sklearn-compat](https://github.com/sklearn-compat/sklearn-compat), a library to help you support different versions of scikit-learn. Especially relevant after the scikit-learn 1.6 API changes.
* Fairlearn's [website](https://fairlearn.org/), and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn).
* [scikit-learn certification](https://certification.probabl.ai/) by :probabl.

That is all for now, see you next week!
