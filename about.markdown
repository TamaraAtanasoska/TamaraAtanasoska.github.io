Hi! My name is Tamara. I am a software engineer, OSS maintainer and NLP/CompLing researcher. You can find out more about me on [GitHub](https://github.com/tamaraatanasoska) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamaraatanasoska/).
This blog is for writing related to the technical work I do, as well as related learnings.
I write on [Substack](https://holophrase.substack.com/) about the intersections of language, technology and society. Some of the topics mentioned here will find an expansion over there.

2025 will be a year of reading and learning, and I will share the papers and books I will go through for my research and to improve my technical skills.
Feel free to add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamaraatanasoska/) if you want to connect or reach out for anything related to what you see here.
